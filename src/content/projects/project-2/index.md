## Overview

I led a team of four in the design, development, and optimization of a **SQL-based relational database** for a library system. Our goal was to create an efficient, scalable, and user-friendly system that could handle all aspects of library management.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Team Leadership:** Managed a team of four throughout the project lifecycle, from database design to implementation and testing.
- **Database Design:** Analyzed user needs to design a **relational database** that met functional requirements while minimizing redundancy through **data normalization**.
- **SQL Development:** Developed SQL queries and used **built-in functions** to extract, manipulate, and analyze data effectively.
- **Performance Optimization:** Focused on optimizing **query performance** to ensure fast data retrieval and efficient system operations.
- **Testing & Implementation:** Populated the database with test data and rigorously tested it to ensure reliability and accuracy.

## Achievements

- **Reduced Data Redundancy:** Achieved efficient data management by applying normalization techniques, leading to reduced redundancy and improved database performance.
- **Optimized SQL Queries:** Enhanced query performance through optimization, ensuring the system was responsive even with large data sets.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**
- **Database Normalization**
- **Query Optimization**
- **Data Analysis**
